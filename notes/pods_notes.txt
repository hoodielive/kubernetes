Pods 
- Contrary to what is possible in a Docker Swarm, you canNOT run containers directly in a Kubernetes cluster. 
- You can only run 'pods'.
- Pods are an atomic unit of deployment in Kubernetes. 
- A pod is an abstraction of one or many co-located containers that share the same Kernel namespaces, such as 
  the network namespace. 

The Anatomy of a Pod: 
POD1 
  netns: ip address 10.0.12.3 of Pod1
    main-container port :80
    support-container port :3000

POD2 
  netns: ip address 10.0.1.2.5 of Pod2

These ip addresses are uniquely (in Kubernetes Cluster) assigned by Kubernetes.
- Both are part of a private subnet managed by the Kubernetes network driver.

More:
- A pod can contain one or many containers. 
- All these containers share the same kernel namespaces, and in particular they share the network namespace.
