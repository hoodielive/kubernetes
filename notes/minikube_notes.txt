Minikube 
- A tool that creates a 'single' node Kubernetes cluster in VirtualBox or Hyper-V 
- Other hypervisors are supported. 
- As a single node Kubernetes cluster, it is both a Kubernetes Master and worker node at the same time. 

Commands:
kubectl get nodes 

Output: NAME  STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION 
Note: <none> in the column ROLES means that its playing both a worker node and a master at the same time.

- the node is called 'minikube'. 

Deploy a pod to this cluster: 
1. Create the following sample-pod.yaml file:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod 
metadata:
  name: nginx 
spec: 
  containers:
  - name: nginx 
  image: nginx:alpine 
  ports: 
  - containerPort: 80
  - containerPort: 443 

2. kubectl create -f sample-pod.yaml
expected output: pod "nginx" created. 

3. kubectl get pods 
NAME    READY    STATUS   RESTARTS  AGE
nginx   1/1      Running  0         51s

To be able to access this pod, you must create a 'service': 
1. Create the folowing service file 'sample-service.yaml'
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service 
metadata: 
  name: nginx-service 
spec: 
  type: LoadBalancer 
  ports:
  - port: 8080 
    targetPort: 80 
    protocol: TCP 
    name: http 
  - port: 443 
    protocol: TCP 
    name: https 
  selector:
    app: nginx 

2. kubectl create -f sample-service.yaml 

3. curl -4 http://localhost 

4. You should be receiving an nginx welcome page.
