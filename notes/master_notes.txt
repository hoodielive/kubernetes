Kubernetes Master nodes 
- Used to manage a Kubernetes cluster. 

Master Infrastructe: 
1. VM on-premise 
2. Cloud 
3. Server (bare-metal)

- Master nodes only run on 'LINUX' i.e. ['RHEL', 'CENTOS', 'Ubuntu']

On Linux Machine: 
  1. API Server: this the gateway to Kubernetes. 
    - All requests to:
        1. List 
        2. Create
        3. Modify 
        4. Delete 
    any resources in the cluster must go through this service. 
    - It exposes a REST interface that tools such as 'kubectl' use to manage the cluster and 
      applications in the cluster. 
  2. Controller: the controller manager, is a control loop that observes the state of the cluster
     through the API server and makes changes, attempting to move the current or effective state toward 
     the desired state. 
  3. Scheduler: a service that tries its best to schedule pods on worker nodes considering various boundary
     conditions, such as:
        1. Resource requirements. 
        2. Policies 
        3. Quality-of-Service requirements.
        4. etc. 
  4. Cluster store: an instance of etcd that is used to store all information about the state of the cluster.
     - Does not have to be installed on the same server that the Kubernetes service is running on. 
     - Can be configured to use standalone clusters of etcd servers. 
     - If high-availiability is a goal, then the etcd instances must also be configured in High-Availability mode, 
       which normally means that you must configure at least 3 etcd instances. 
     - The whole cluster state is stored in etcd. 
       :: thats all the information about all the cluster nodes, all replica sets, deployments, secrets, network policies
       , routing information and so on.

- Requires at least 1 Master node but to acheive High Availiablity, you need at least 3. 
- Kubernetes master ndoes never run 'an application workload'. 
- Their sole purpose is to master the cluster. 
- Builds a Raft Consensus group. 

The Raft protocol is a standard protocol used in situations where a group of members need to make decisions.
